<!-- - [ ]  You should see your random quote generator application with a button to generate quotes.
- [ ]  Test the quote generator by clicking the button and verifying that it displays random quotes 
from the predefined list.

That's it! You've created a simple random quote generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project introduces you to basic concepts such as handling user events and manipulating the DOM without the need for complex APIs or external dependencies. Feel free to expand upon this project
 or explore other ideas as you continue learning JavaScript. -->
